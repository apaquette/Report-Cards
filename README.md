## Task
Create a menu program for a report card that lets the user either create a student record, display all the students records (no NULL records), or display a class average (by course code), or display a studentâ€™s average (by using studentâ€™s first and last name). This program should contain a data structure that has an array to store first name and last name of up to 5 student, and a two-dimension array that would hold the studentâ€™s grade and course code number according to the legend below. Make it user proof. (Make sure that even an History teacher could use it!)
